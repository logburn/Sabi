# Sabi
An encrypted Snapchat alternative. The app will be open source and private. Hopefully publishing to F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid and Play Store. Currently, the planned encryption method is PGP, though this is subject to change.

## Guiding principles
 1. "hide" the encryption for ease of use
 2. a beautiful user interface
 3. modular design for encryption so it can be changed later
 4. "Minimum Viable Centralization" - only store information on a server as a midpoint to increase stability

## Planned features
#### Text chat
 - messaging
 - encryption
 - robust texting (link previews etc)
 - file uploads (images, maybe documents)
 - delete after x time
 - sending/send/viewed visual

#### Picture chats
 - picture chats
 - content warnings (nsfw, custom?)
 - show for x time
 - replays
 - stories
 - send to multiple people
 
#### Accounts
 - accounts
 - account sharing via link and QR code
 - profile info
 - online status (green, yellow, white)
 - account backup/moving (online and local)
 - deletion
 - account age
 - profile info (short paragraph)
 
 #### Misc
 - custom app color
 - lowercase/uppercase letters
 - streaks

## Under consideration

#### Likely, but not guaranteed
 - location sharing (live?)
 - save to gallary
 - profile pictures (unsure how to implement)
 - multiple stories with limits on who can view
 - opt-in, privacy-friendly, ads
 - group chats

#### Unlikely, but possible
 - public stories
 - account locking
 - P2P/Bluetooth messaging
 - sort contacts (friends, acquaintances, family, etc)
 - multi-person viewing, must view at same time to see message
