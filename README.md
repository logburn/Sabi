# Sabi
An encrypted Snapchat alternative. The app will be open source and private. Hopefully publishing to F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid and Play Store. Currently, I plan to use PGP for encryption. I may use XMPP as well but I'm not yet convinced it's the easiest solution, even if it is the "best".

## Guiding principles
 1. user-friendly and simple UI
 2. "hide" the encryption for ease of use
 3. "Minimum Viable Centralization" - only store information on a server as a midpoint to increase stability
 4. no reinventing the wheel

## Planned technologies & resources
 - the impressive (and free!) (Undraw)[https://undraw.co/] library of SVGs
 - PGP for both encryption and user verification
 - backend undecided
 - Kotlin for app development (no iOS support planned)

## Planned features
#### Text chat
 - messaging
 - encryption
 - robust texting (link previews etc)
 - file uploads (images, maybe documents)
 - delete after x time
 - sending/send/viewed visual

#### Picture chats
 - picture chats
 - content warnings (nsfw, custom?)
 - show for x time
 - replays
 - stories
 - send to multiple people
 - text labels
 
#### Accounts
 - accounts
 - account sharing via link and QR code
 - profile info
 - online status (green, yellow, white)
 - account backup/moving (online and local)
 - deletion
 - account age
 - profile info (short paragraph)
 
 #### Misc
 - custom app color
 - lowercase/uppercase letters
 - streaks

## Under consideration

#### Likely, but not guaranteed
 - location sharing (live?)
 - save to gallary
 - profile pictures (unsure how to implement)
 - multiple stories with limits on who can view
 - opt-in, privacy-friendly, ads
 - group chats
 - website companion 
 - time delayed sending

#### Unlikely, but possible
 - public stories
 - account locking
 - P2P/Bluetooth messaging
 - sort contacts (friends, acquaintances, family, etc)
 - multi-person viewing, must view at same time to see message
 - multiple accounts
 - iOS support (very unlikely)
